Welcome to my blog! I am a 14-year-old who's finished his Grade 12, and is exploring the world. I'm blogging as a hobby so I can look back on my life and see my progression, and think to myself: "Wow, I was like this back then?". Oh and of course, you're invited along for the journey. See you on the other side!
