Hey! To stay anonymous, I'm not going to reveal my real name on here, so let's just call me _X. I've finished my A-Levels, and I'm currently 14 years old. I enjoy cooking up tasty meals, reading a long, nice book, travelling with friends and family, Chess online, and Minecraft with my friends.

I'm interested in Mathematics and Physics, and I want to be a mathematician or a physicist someday. I want to bring something new to the world, be it in research or a concept or an app or an idea. I also want it to be impactful, and make the world a better place.
